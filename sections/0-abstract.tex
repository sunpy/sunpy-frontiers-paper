\begin{abstract}
The \sunpyproj is a community of scientists and software developers creating an ecosystem of Python packages for solar physics.
The project includes the \sunpypkg core package as well as a set of affiliated packages.
The \sunpypkg core package provides general purpose tools to access data from different providers, read image and time series data, and transform between commonly used coordinate systems.
Affiliated packages perform more specialized tasks that do not fall within the more general scope of the \sunpypkg core package.
In this article, we give a high-level overview of the \sunpyproj, how it is broader than the \sunpypkg core package, and how the project curates and fosters the affiliated package system.
We demonstrate how components of the \sunpy ecosystem, including \sunpypkg and several affiliated packages, work together to enable multi-instrument data analysis workflows.
We also describe members of the \sunpyproj and how the project interacts with the wider solar physics and scientific Python communities.
Finally, we discuss the future direction and priorities of the \sunpyproj.
