# Manuscript Contribution

The SunPy Project oversees the development of the sunpy package and the SunPy affiliated package ecosystem to foster an interoperable data analysis environment for solar physics in the Python programming language.
The sunpy package provides general purpose tools to access data from different providers, read image and time series data, and transform between commonly used coordinate systems.
Because of its stability and breadth, sunpy has become a widely used tool throughout the solar physics and heliophysics community.
This is particularly true as Python becomes an increasingly popular choice of language in solar physics and astronomy as a whole.
This paper lays out the structure of the project in order to better define the separation between the sunpy package and the SunPy project and encourage contributions from across the solar physics community.
This paper contributes to the wider solar physics community by making the SunPy Project more accessible and lowering the barrier to those developing affiliated packages.
This is especially important in the case of instrument teams developing analysis software as interoperable tools between instruments are critical to enabling scientific discovery via multi-instrument studies.
